Implementation of the paper: Link

Please download the pickle files(as used by the code) of the processed data using this link: Data and Word2Vec Model. The above link contains 5 files as follows:

train_data.p : Used for training the model
desired_train_data.p : Desired output values for the training data
test_data.p : Used for testing the model
desired_test_data.p : The actual expected results for the test data
wordvectors1.kv : The word2vec model used to develop the word embeddings for the news text
The implementation uses the architecture as given in the above paper but a few modifications has been made to the hyperparameters and implementation specifications to improve on the same.
